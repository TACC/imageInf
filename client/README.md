# Frontend Demo ‚Äì ImageInf

This is a minimal single-page application (SPA) built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to illustrate the frontend portion of the **ImageInf** service.

It is intended as a developer-facing demo for exploring how the UI might interact with the backend API and display inference results.
